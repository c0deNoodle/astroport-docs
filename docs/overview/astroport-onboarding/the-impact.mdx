# The Impact

The essential primitive within any DeFi ecosystem is the asset exchange functionality. Automated Market Makers (AMMs) like Astroport enable swaps in a decentralized, non-custodial, way. 

With Astroport, liquidity providers (LPs) can choose different pool types within a single and effective AMM system. Thus, anyone can onboard and trade tokens in a permissionless way. Moreover, no captain or bureaucrat can stop them, as the station is owned solely by its users.

- Dual token rewards for liquidity providers
- State-of-the-art shared fee structure for LPs and stakers
- On-chain trades or access to an outstanding user experience with cutting-edge charting design work on astroport.fi
