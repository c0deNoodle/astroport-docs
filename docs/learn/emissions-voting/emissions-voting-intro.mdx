# Emissions Voting (vxASTRO)

The vxASTRO contract enables xASTRO token holders to lock their tokens and participate in Emissions Voting.

## Features

- **Indefinite Locking:** Tokens are locked indefinitely, with an option for users to request unlocking at any time.
- **Unlocking Period:** The vxASTRO unlocking process takes 14 days.
- **Voting Power:** vxASTRO voting power (equivalent to the underlying xASTRO share) can be used to direct ASTRO emissions.
- **Governance:** vxASTRO holders retain their normal Astroport Governance voting power while locked.
- **Non-Transferable:** vxASTRO tokens cannot be swapped or transferred across addresses.
- **CW20 Queries:** The contract implements several CW20 queries to function like a CW20 token for query purposes, useful for wallet views.
- **Emissions Controller Interaction:** The contract interacts with the Emissions Controller whenever a user's balance changes, updating the user's contribution in Emissions Voting.

The Emissions Controller allows vxASTRO holders to vote on ASTRO emissions. This Hub's contract is responsible for collecting votes from vxASTRO stakers from all outposts and calculating the final ASTRO emissions every epoch.

## Usage

Locking xASTRO for vxASTRO will immediately grant voting power to influence liquidity flows with ASTRO emissions across the outposts. vxASTRO holders will be able to vote on emissions each epoch as well as participate in the governance of Astroport. Votes may be allocated to a maximum of five pools, only once per epoch. Once votes are cast they cannot be changed until the next epoch. 

### Locking xASTRO (or ASTRO) for vxASTRO
- xASTRO holders may lock their xASTRO tokens to receive an equivalent amount of vxASTRO tokens. 
- ASTRO holders may stake and lock their tokens for vxASTRO in a single step, and will receive an amount of vxASTRO relative to the current xASTRO:ASTRO staking ratio. This is because the ASTRO tokens are first staked for xASTRO and then subsequently locked for vxASTRO in a single transaction.

**Note:** If the user has already voted with an existing amount of vxASTRO, this additional locked amount will increase their vote proportionately for the same previously selected pools.

### Unlocking vxASTRO for xASTRO
- Immediately upon beginning the 14-day unlock period, any existing votes by the user will be nullified and their total voting power will decrease.
- At any time during the 14-day unlock period the user may decide to relock the full vxASTRO position. This will immediately cancel the unlock and recover the user's full voting power. Any votes that were in place before the unlock process began would be reinstated to their prior voting weights (you can still change your vote at any time before the epoch ends).
- After the full 14-day unlock period has passed, the user may then select to withdraw xASTRO. The xASTRO will then be returned to their address on the outpost they were originally locked from.

**Note:** You may cancel the unlocking process at any time within the 14-day period, and any previous votes made in the same epoch would be restored.
