Astroport's permissionless bribing system offers a streamlined and democratized approach to deploying bribes for pools. Now, anyone can add bribes to any pool with up to five different tokens. Here's how it works:

1. **Select a Pool:** Users begin by choosing which liquidity pool they wish to add a bribe to.
2. **Define Bribe Token/Amount:** They then select the token and amount with which they want to add as bribe to the pool.
3. **Sign and Confirm:** The final step involves signing and confirming the transaction, with a 1500 ASTRO fee to activate the bribe.

Continue below for an in-depth guide on deploying bribes.

### Step 1: Head over to [https://app.astroport.fi/pools](https://app.astroport.fi/pools) and select **Bribe Pool**.

The **Bribe Pool** button can be found on the top right of the **Pools** page.
