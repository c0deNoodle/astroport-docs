Astroport's new permissionless incentive system offers a streamlined and democratized approach to deploying incentives for pools. Now, anyone can incentivize any pool with up to five different tokens. Here's how it works:

1. **Select a Pool:** Users begin by choosing which liquidity pool they wish to incentivize.
2. **Define Incentives:** They then select the token(s) with which they want to incentivize the pool.
3. **Set Duration:** Users set the duration of the incentive, ranging from a minimum of 1 week to a maximum of 25 weeks. The total amount of the incentive will be distributed either linearly or decreasingly over this period.
4. **Sign and Confirm:** The final step involves signing and confirming the transaction, with a 1500 ASTRO fee to activate the incentives.

Continue below for an in-depth guide on deploying incentives.

### Step 1: Head over to [https://app.astroport.fi/pools](https://app.astroport.fi/pools) and select **Incentivize Pool**.

The **Incentivize Pool** button can be found on the top right of the **Pools** page.

### Step 3: Define Incentives

First, we select the token we will be using to incentivize the pool.

### Step 4: Set Incentives Amount

Next, we define the amount of incentives that are being deposited.

### Step 5: Define Duration 

Lastly, we define the incentives schedule, or how many weeks your incentives will last. Your total incentive amount will be distributed linearly or decreasingly. Incentives require a minimum of 1 week and a maximum of 25 weeks. 

Note that rewards per second must be at least 1 unit.

You can expand the duration tab to see incentives distributed per week for your defined schedule.

### Step 6: Sign and Confirm transaction

Once complete, your incentives schedule should begin!
