# Vault Pools

Supervaults are Neutron’s flagship DeFi innovation that leverage Neutron’s architecture in order to create powerful automated market-making vaults, fully automated and on-chain.

These vaults will automatically rebalance positions across different price ranges and fee tiers to achieve maximal capital efficiency and improve outcomes for both traders and liquidity providers. Supervaults automate arbitrage sending 100% of the profit to the vault, increasing volume on chain, making swaps more efficient, and puts more profit in the hands of real users.

## Direct Access to Supervaults via Astroport UI

Supervaults can be found listed on the Astroport Pools page. You can scroll down the list to find them, use the search box, or filter to only see Vault pools available. When depositing to Supervaults on Astroport you receive Astroport LP tokens that represent the Astroport-deposited vault position. This means that when depositing to Supervaults via Astroport UI you will not be able to see or manage your position on Neutron's UI, and likewise when depositing via Neutron's UI you will not be able to see/manage that same position from the Astroport UI.
