# Astro Bribes

Astroport's native permissionless bribe system allows anyone to add bribes to any pool on any of Astroport's outposts.

## Inventivising vxASTRO Voting

Bribes provide an additional method to incentivise users to provide liquidity to a specific pool. This can be done instead of adding rewards through Astroportâ€™s incentives contract, 
or even directly alongside it. Added bribes will be awarded to vxASTRO holders in exchange for their votes towards a specific pool.

The more vxASTRO votes a pool receives during the current epoch, the more likely it is allocated a portion of the ASTRO emissions for the following epoch.

Note that only the top voted pools will receive emissions next epoch (see [Emissions Voting](./emissions-voting/emissions-voting-intro) for more info).

More information is available under the [Adding Bribes](./workstation/bribes/bribes-intro) section.
